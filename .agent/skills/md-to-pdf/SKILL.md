# Md to PDF Skill

Converts a markdown file to a PDF by first creating an intermediate LaTeX file and then compiling it using `xelatex`.
Convert word for word, everything must be IDENTICAL. Make spaces between paragraphs nice and proper for the document to look good.

## When to use this skill

- When the user asks to convert a markdown file to PDF or simply says "pdf" while a markdown file is active.

## Workflow

1. **MD to TEX**: Convert the markdown content to a structured LaTeX (`.tex`) file word for word.
   - Set the author to **Vuk Rosić \\ \small \raisebox{-0.2\height}{\includegraphics[width=0.02\textwidth]{/Users/vukrosic/AI Science Projects/AI Blog Writing/.agent/skills/md-to-pdf/github.jpg}} \texttt{vukrosic}**.
   - Use standard packages: `fontspec` (for Unicode), `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `hyperref`, `geometry`, `booktabs`, `enumitem`, `parskip` (for spacing 
   between paragraphs), `setspace` (for line spacing), `graphicx`.
   - Images in tex must be at the exact same spot and order with text as in markdown file. Text is dependent on image location, and it must be same as in the markdown file in that order with respect to text.
   - **Styling Rules**:
     - Set page margin to `1.2in`.
     - Set line spacing to `1.15` using `\setstretch{1.15}`.
     - Disable section numbering using `\setcounter{secnumdepth}{0}`.
     - **Never include a date**: Ensure `\date{}` is used or the date is otherwise omitted.
     - Do not use horizontal lines (`\hrule`).
2. **TEX to PDF**: Compile the `.tex` file using `xelatex`.
   - Run the command twice to ensure all references and PDF metadata are generated.

## Commands

```bash
# Compile command (run twice)
xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode "filename.tex"
```
